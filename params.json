  "body": "## M. Bret Blackford - E-22 project\r\nThis code was written for Harvard Extension CSCI E-22 - Data Structures.  The code implements a variable length encoding/decoding compression algorithm using Huffman trees.\r\n\r\n## Computer Science E-22 Data Structures\r\n### Course description\r\nThis course is a survey of fundamental data structures for information processing — including lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The course explores the implementation of these data structures (including both array-based and linked representations) and examines classic algorithms that use these structures for tasks such as sorting, searching, and text compression. Techniques for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms are also covered. The Java programming language will be used to demonstrate the concepts discussed in lecture, and programming problems must be completed in Java. Key notions of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation and abstract data types, are emphasized.\r\n### Instructor\r\nDavid G.
